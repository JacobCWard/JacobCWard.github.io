# My Favorite Bridges

A while back I was listening to an episode of the 'Hello Internet' podcast in which the hosts discussed their "Top 5 Bridges" and I thought I would write about my own.

It was difficult for me to limit it to just five bridges, so I split the list into two categories: my favorite bridges I've crossed in a vehicle, and my favorite bridges I've crossed only by foot.

1. Perrine Bridge - Twin Falls, ID
2. Fishing Bridge - Yellowstone National Park, WY
3. Astoria-Megler - Astoria, OR
4. Yellowstone River Bridge (I-94 Frontage Road) - Fallon, MT
5. Hansen Bridge - Twin Falls, ID


1. Historic Old Washington Street Pedestrian Bridge - Indianapolis, IN
2. Benson Footbridge - Multnomah Falls, OR
3. Arlington Memorial Bridge - Washington, DC
