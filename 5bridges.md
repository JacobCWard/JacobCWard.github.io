# My Favorite Bridges

A while back I was listening to an episode of the 'Hello Internet' podcast in which the hosts discussed their "Top 5 Bridges" and I thought I would write about my own.

It was difficult for me to limit it to just five bridges, so I split the list into two categories: my favorite bridges I've crossed in a vehicle, and my favorite bridges I've crossed only by foot.

1. Perrine Bridge - Twin Falls, ID
    - I remember this bridge from fairly early in my memory. When my family would travel from Meridian, ID to Pocatello, ID, we would often stop in Twin Falls as a nice halfway point. I specifically remember stopping to eat at the Outback Steakhouse that sits just south of the canyon, sharing a parking lot with the observation point for the canyon.
2. Fishing Bridge - Yellowstone National Park, WY
    - This bridge was historically used as a place from which one would fish during the spawning season on Yellowstone Lake. There are photographs of men lined up shoulder to shoulder, each with a fishing line in hand.
3. Astoria-Megler - Astoria, OR
    - 
4. Yellowstone River Bridge (I-94 Frontage Road) - Fallon, MT
    -
5. Hansen Bridge - Twin Falls, ID
    -


1. Historic Old Washington Street Pedestrian Bridge - Indianapolis, IN
    -
2. Benson Footbridge - Multnomah Falls, OR
    -
3. Arlington Memorial Bridge - Washington, DC
