# My Favorite Bridges
## Work in Progress

A while back I was listening to an episode of the 'Hello Internet' podcast in which the hosts discussed their "Top 5 Bridges" and I thought I would write about my own.

It was difficult for me to limit it to just five bridges, so I split the list into two categories: my favorite bridges I've crossed in a vehicle, and my favorite bridges I've crossed only by foot.

1. Perrine Bridge - Twin Falls, ID
    - I remember this bridge from fairly early in my memory. When my family would travel from Meridian, ID to Pocatello, ID, we would often stop in Twin Falls as a nice halfway point. I specifically remember stopping to eat at the Outback Steakhouse that sits just south of the canyon, sharing a parking lot with the observation point for the canyon.
2. Fishing Bridge - Yellowstone National Park, WY
    - This bridge was historically used as a place from which one would fish during the spawning season on Yellowstone Lake. There are photographs of men lined up shoulder to shoulder, each with a fishing line in hand.
3. Astoria-Megler - Astoria, OR
    - Following the end of my sophomore year at Southern Utah University, I had a week before my summer job began. I was staying at my uncle's house in Pocatello, and decided to go for a drive. It first began as a drive through Arbon Valley, but I really wasn't ready to head back when I reached the interstate, so I thought I'd drive to Twin Falls (incidentally crossing two other bridges on this list). Still not feeling like heading back I drove to Boise, at which point I thought "Oregon is just a bit further..." Upon reaching Oregon, I decided, I'm this far, I might as well drive to Portland... (nearly 400 miles away). I spent the night in Baker City, and continued my drive westward. Along the way, I passed Multnomah Falls, which features later in this list. Reaching Portland, I decided to go to the coast, not realizing how far inland Portland actually is. I drove to Seaside, and witnessed the Pacific Ocean for the first time. I then drove north toward Astoria.
    - After visiting the Astoria tower, and seeing getting a spectacular view from the top, I drove to the bridge, a magnificent structure with a steep approach on the south side, and then a long, flat surface continuing to the Washington side of the river.
    - I guess the significance of this bridge for me is the liberating, introspective drive that I took to get to it, but it's still an awesome sight to see.
4. Yellowstone River Bridge (I-94 Frontage Road) - Fallon, MT
    - I first saw this bridge on my way to Williston, ND one summer. On my return trip, I made a point of going to drive over it. Truss bridges have always been really cool to me because of the linear shapes that they feature. and the cool patterns their shadows cast.
5. Hansen Bridge - Twin Falls, ID
    - Just up the river from the Perrine Bridge, I was unaware of this bridge for much of my life, even though nearly every time I'd travel from Pocatello to Boise, we'd stop at the truck stop less than a mile away. I stopped at this bridge on my Astoria road trip as well.


1. Historic Old Washington Street Pedestrian Bridge - Indianapolis, IN
    - I lived and worked on the campus of IUPUI during the summer of 2015 and had large amounts of free time in the evenings on the weekends. Just a short walk from campus, this bridge is a lovely place to just sit and watch the White River and view the Indianapolis skyline. Indianapolis is definitely a place I would consider living, despite its lack of mountains. (And that is really saying something since I LOVE mountains.)
2. Benson Footbridge - Multnomah Falls, OR
    - The Benson Footbridge crosses above the lower falls of Multnomah Falls. I hiked this trail in the spring of 2009 when my high school FIRST robotics team 'Haywire' was on its way to the Portland Regional. (I would have hiked the trail again on my Astoria trip, but it was being repaired after sustaining damage from a falling rock in January of 2014.) While the magnificent falls are more of the view than the bridge itself, the significance of a bridge lies just as much in what it crosses as it does in and of itself.
3. Arlington Memorial Bridge - Washington, DC
    - During my junior year of high school, I had the opportunity to attend the Business Professionals of America National Leadership Conference. As my advisor and I were the only members of my chapter in attendance, we had plenty of time to visit the numerous sites in our nation's capital.
    - One evening we took the train to the Pentagon and visited the 9/11 memorial there. After visiting that humbling site, we took the train to the hallowed ground of Arlington National Cemetery. Due to the lateness of the hour of our visit, we weren't able to enter the cemetery. However, because of our ample site-seeing time, we paid a visit the next day, again taking the train.
    - After visiting the cemetery, we took a leisurely stroll across the bridge to the Lincoln Memorial. It was a beautiful day, and a spectacular bridge to cross.
