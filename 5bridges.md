# My Favorite Bridges

A while back I was listening to an episode of the 'Hello Internet' podcast in which the hosts discussed their "Top 5 Bridges" and I thought I would write about my own.

It was difficult for me to limit it to just five bridges, so I split the list into two categories: my favorite bridges I've crossed in a vehicle, and my favorite bridges I've crossed only by foot.

1. Perrine Bridge - Twin Falls, ID
    - I remember this bridge from fairly early in my memory. When my family would travel from Meridian, ID to Pocatello, ID, we would often stop in Twin Falls as a nice halfway point. I specifically remember stopping to eat at the Outback Steakhouse that sits just south of the canyon, sharing a parking lot with the observation point for the canyon.
2. Fishing Bridge - Yellowstone National Park, WY
    - This bridge was historically used as a place from which one would fish during the spawning season on Yellowstone Lake. There are photographs of men lined up shoulder to shoulder, each with a fishing line in hand.
3. Astoria-Megler - Astoria, OR
    - Following the end of my sophomore year at Southern Utah University, I had a week before my summer job began. I was staying at my uncle's house in Pocatello, and decided to go for a drive. It first began as a drive through Arbon Valley, but I really wasn't ready to head back when I reached the interstate, so I thought I'd drive to Twin Falls (incidentally crossing two other bridges on this list). Still not feeling like heading back I drove to Boise, at which point I thought "Oregon is just a bit further..." Upon reaching Oregon, I decided, I'm this far, I might as well drive to Portland... (nearly 400 miles away). I spent the night in Baker City, and continued my drive westward. Along the way, I passed Multnomah Falls, which features later in this list. Reaching Portland, I decided to go to the coast, not realizing how far inland Portland actually is. I drove to Seaside, and witnessed the Pacific Ocean for the first time. I then drove north toward Astoria.
    - After visiting the Astoria tower, and seeing getting a spectacular view from the top, I drove to the bridge, a magnificent structure with a steep approach on the south side, and then a long, flat surface continuing to the Washington side of the river.
    - I guess the significance of this bridge for me is the liberating, introspective drive that I took to get to it, but it's still an awesome sight to see.
