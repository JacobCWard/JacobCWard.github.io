# Super Bowl Commercials

I watched all of the commercials during the Super Bowl this year. I was rather disappointed overall.

Helen Mirren????

Hyundai Genesis - Kevin Hart | Treats guys as though they are constantly trying to do harm to women. Treated the girl like she was unable to protect herself or judge her date as a good guy, which he was otherwise portrayed to be.

Lady Gaga singing the national anthem!!! Love it!

10 Cloverfield Lane | meh. won't see because it's not my thing

Intel | Cool Commercial - nothing especially noteworthy

ExxonMobil | meh.

Hyundai Genesis - Engine Hearts | strange. was the car even in the commercial?

Michelob Ultra - Exhale | Weird

Snickers Marylin | odd.

SoFi - Great | Great? maybe

Avocados from Mexico | Weird. Kinda funny. Memetic

Hyundai Elantra - Bears | We get it you have a nice car. Talking bears were kinda funny
